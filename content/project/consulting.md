A Ryerson journalism graduate and freelance writer, Rebecca also brings over 10 years experience in media relations (for non-profits and community groups) to her media relations workshops. Rebecca has been conducting media relations workshops since 2010 for groups including the Canadian Federation of Students-Nova Scotia (CFS-NS), the Dalhousie Student Union (DSU), the Nova Scotia Rainbow Action Project (NSRAP) and ACORN.

These workshops focus on: using media as a tactic (or tool), which compliments your strategy and helps you achieve your goal(s); developing (and sticking to) a message box; how to generate media; crisis management; and what to do when the media calls.
