Like many 30-somethings, Rebecca has spent her entire adult life on social media. Additionally she has helped run social media accounts for various non-profit and community groups including: Friends of the Khyber, Leave Out ViolencE (LOVE) Nova Scotia, Hope Blooms and the Canadian Freelance Union (CFU).

Rebecca has been facilitating workshops on social media since 2013 to audiences with a wide range of tech backgrounds: from people who have never used a computer to those who obsessively check Facebook on their phone. Tailored to each unique audience these workshops can include: the basics (i.e. setting up your accounts, sharing etc.); understanding and utilizing Facebook analytics; and using social media to bring people together, improve communication, get your message out, and make change. Rebecca also has experience working with individuals in a one-on-one setting.

Best of all, she is guaranteed to have more patience than your kids.
